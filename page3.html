            <h2>The History of the Festival</h2>
            <p>2022 marks the 40th annual Apple Harvest! Aside from being home to one of the most agriculturally rich areas of land in the country, New York state is also the 2nd largest producer of apples. Apple Harvest not only enjoys the delicious products of the area, but also it honors the celebrations that the Finger Lakes Iriquois would hold every year marking the beginning of the harvest season. The festival originated when Anna Steinkraus and a few local farmers decided to create a celebration for their seasonal harvests. Anna Steinkraus, despite being the co-owner of Littletree Orchards and serving as President of the Ithaca Farmers Market board of directors, has continued to make time to attend the festival.</p>
