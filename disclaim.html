<p style="color:white;">*disclaimer* I did not build Waffle Insurance's website on my own, nor did I design and subsequently develop each design feature on their site. I did, however, contribute to the UX / UI design, flow, and functionality of their active site (linked below), offering changes that were implemented and are now visible on their site.</p>
